          <h2>
            At BGS, we are passionate about increasing biodiversity; it’s at the
            very heart of why Will formed the company.
          </h2>
          <p>
            If you have an area of the garden that you are unsure on what to do with – Wildflower turf can be a great solution. Not only is it fantastic for the environment increasing biodiversity & attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies it is also a low maintenance solution requiring only one-two cuts per year!
          </p>
          <p> 
            Did you know that wildflowers and grasses help to catch both water & air pollution. They actually capture co2 more efficiently than trees and store it into the soil.
            There are multiple choices of wildflower products with six pre-made turf options: Landscape 34 Turf, Species Rich Lawn Turf, Shade Tolerant, SuDS, Native Enriched, Wildflower Roof Turf.
        </p>

        <p>If the job is undertaken in the autumn additional interest and variety can be added by spreading a crate of specially selected bulbs underneath the turf.
        Another way in which we can create a wildflower area is to spread Meadowscape Pro which is a premixed seed and topsoil.
        </p>
        <p> 
          <strong>Bespoke turf and Meadowscape can also be created and installed upon request.</strong>
